            <h2>Bentota Turtle Hatchary</h2>
            <h3>Bentota turtle hatchary-Bentota</h3>
            <p>
            <p>Bentota turtle hatchery is a conservation center located in the southern part of Sri Lanka. It is a
                non-profit organization that aims to protect and conserve sea turtles by providing a safe environment
                for their eggs to hatch and their young to grow. The hatchery was established in 1986 and has since then
                been a popular tourist attraction, drawing visitors from all over the world. </p><br>
            <p>The hatchery is located on the beach and has several large tanks where the turtles are kept. The tanks
                are filled with seawater and are maintained at a temperature that is suitable for the turtles. The
                hatchery is home to five different species of sea turtles, including the Green Turtle, Olive Ridley
                Turtle, Hawksbill Turtle, Loggerhead Turtle, and Leatherback Turtle.</p><br>
            <p>The hatchery has a team of trained staff who are responsible for taking care of the turtles. They collect
                the eggs from the beach and bring them to the hatchery where they are kept in a safe environment until
                they hatch. Once the eggs hatch, the baby turtles are kept in the tanks until they are strong enough to
                be released into the ocean.</p><br>
            <p> Visitors to the hatchery can take a tour of the facility and learn about the different species of sea
                turtles that live there. The staff at the hatchery are knowledgeable about the turtles and are happy to
                answer any questions that visitors may have. Visitors can also watch as the staff feed the turtles and
                learn about the different foods that they eat.</p><br>
            <p>One of the main attractions at the hatchery is the release of the baby turtles into the ocean. This
                happens every evening at around 6 pm when the sun has set. Visitors can watch as the baby turtles make
                their way down to the water and begin their journey into the ocean. This is a truly magical experience
                and one that visitors will never forget.

                The hatchery also has a gift shop where visitors can buy souvenirs and gifts. The shop sells a range of
                items including t-shirts, hats, keychains, and postcards. All the proceeds from the gift shop go towards
                supporting the hatchery and its conservation efforts.</p><br>
            <p> In addition to its conservation efforts, the hatchery also plays an important role in educating the
                local community about the importance of sea turtle conservation. The hatchery runs educational programs
                for local schools and community groups, teaching them about the different species of sea turtles and the
                threats that they face. This education is crucial in ensuring that future generations are aware of the
                importance of protecting these magnificent creatures.

        <p>The hatchery also works with local fishermen to promote sustainable fishing practices. By working with the
            fishermen, the hatchery is able to reduce the number of sea turtles that are accidentally caught in fishing
            nets. This is an important step in protecting the sea turtle population and ensuring their survival for
            future generations.</p><br>
    </div>
    <div class="para3">
        <p>In conclusion, Bentota turtle hatchery is a wonderful place to visit for anyone interested in sea turtle
            conservation. The hatchery provides a safe environment for sea turtles to hatch and grow, and its staff are
            dedicated to protecting these magnificent creatures. Visitors to the hatchery can learn about the different
            species of sea turtles, watch as the baby turtles are released into the ocean, and support the hatchery's
            conservation efforts by purchasing souvenirs from the gift shop. Overall, Bentota turtle hatchery is a
            must-visit destination for anyone visiting Sri Lanka.
